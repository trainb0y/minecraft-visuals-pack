# Trainb0y's Better Visuals Pack

[Modrinth Page](https://modrinth.com/modpack/trainb0ys-visual-pack)

This modpack is fully client-side and works on any server. It changes nothing about vanilla gameplay, and only adds visual optimizations and improvements.

### Why:

In the ye olde days of Minecraft, Optifine was the go-to performance and visual overhaul for Minecraft. Sadly, over the years issues with it have cropped up.

#### Optifine is
   - Slow to update
   - Closed source
   - Doesn't work well on Fabric/Quilt (even Optifabric)
   - Incompatible with many mods

However, for a while there was no good alternative. To this day, no single mod can replace all of the wonderful features of Optifine. This pack, however, aims to collect many individual mods and put them together as a solid, performant, Optifine replacement.
### Features:

   - Insane FPS (Sodium)
   - Optifine-compatible Shaders (Iris)
   - Connected Textures (Continuity)
   - Zoom (LogicalZoom)
   - Rewritten Lighting Engine (Starlight)
   - Optimized Network Stack (Krypton)
   - Dynamic Lighting (LambDynamicLights)

### Other mods:

Dynamic FPS, LazyDFU, Mod Menu, Sodium Extra, Reese's Sodium Options, Indium, ResolutionControl+
